This project predicts the comprehensive strength of concrete on basis of constituents added to it.

Data Source :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/concrete-compressive-strength-data-set

Work is done in jupyter-notebook.

Problem Statement:-
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering.The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,
water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
Data is in raw form(not scaled). Build a predictive model to predict comprehensive strength of concrete as per quantity of ingredients added to it.
